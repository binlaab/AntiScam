# AntiScam
Discord bot code to stop users that are scamming with fake messages of free discord nitro on servers in order to steal users accounts.

# How to use
Just run `AntiScam.py` with python, like this: `python AntiScam.py`

To run the bot, the PyCord module must be installed (if you have installed pip3, it can be installed with `sudo pip3 install py-cord` for Linux `python -m pip install py-cord` for Windows)

EDIT: My version is just a fork who contains the entire code in one file and more commented

TODO: better errors.
